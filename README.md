- Lock or unlock which value you want to edit (locked values are automatically calculated)
- Enter value
- Change to the unit you want to use
- That's it!

#### Number formats

The input field is a string that gets converted to a number so instead of 1000000 (one million) you can type 1,000,000 or 1 million. The result is the same.
Unlocking some values will lock the others and those locked ones will be calculated automatically.
The range of a created object size must be between **0.1 nanometers (1e-10 meters)** and **~52 lunar distances (2e10 meters)**

#### Description box at the top

The description gets automatically generated when an object is created, but you can edit the text however you want.
